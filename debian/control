Description: Powerful and easy to use desktop calculator - library
 Qalculate! is small and simple to use but with much power and versatility
 underneath.  Features include customizable functions, units, arbitrary
 precision, plotting, and a graphical interface that uses a one-line
 fault-tolerant expression entry (although it supports optional traditional
 buttons).
 .
 This package contains the shared library used by all Qalculate! frontends.
